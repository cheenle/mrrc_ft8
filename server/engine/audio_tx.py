"""Bounded 48 kHz float32 playback with cancellation (AD-004, §11.2).

The TX waveform produced by the DSP Worker is exactly 48 kHz float32 mono
(§9.4); nothing else may reach the output device.  Playback is bounded by
construction: at most ``MAX_TX_SAMPLES`` samples (one FT8 waveform) are
accepted, blocks are written sequentially and :meth:`TxPlayer.cancel`
aborts the stream between or during blocks.  The safety controller adds
the per-transmission time deadline on top (NFR-057).
